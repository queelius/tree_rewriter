Tree Rewriter
=============

Tree Rewriter is a Python package for rewriting trees (which can represent
things like expressions). The package provides a low-level interface for
rewrites (which we call rules, but technically they are just functions).
Normally, you would want to use a higher-level interface, but for more
tricky cases, you can use this low-level interface.
